# Who We Are


We are graduate students, faculty, and administrators from the computer science (CS) community in western Massachusetts. We started out as a group of graduate students from the CS department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst trying to do our political part for an hour each week. This way we could spend the rest of our focus on research, without the distraction of daily politics. While our group began as a small political activism group of concerned students within UMass Amherst, we have quickly grown into an independent organization of roughly 15 organizers and over 30 active members. We are not, and never have been, directly affiliated with the University. The CICS in our name reflects the nature of our common ties, and not our sponsorship.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to resist discrimination, the rejection of scientific fact, hate speech, and fascism. We refuse to use our skills in ways that conflict with this mission, and urge employers to publicly stand with us. We support and advocate for the work of individuals and groups that align with our objectives.
