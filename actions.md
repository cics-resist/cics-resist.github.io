# CICS Opinion Poll

{% include image.html url="/images/poll_plots.001.jpeg"  width=400 align="right" %}

In this day and age, businesses, especially those in the tech industry, can not remain politically or ethically neutral. We believe it is the responsibility of those employed in the tech industry to hold businesses accountable for their political positions. As students, we can exercise this responsibility by taking politics into account when making decisions about where to work. In fact, many students already take the political stances of a company into account.

To quantify this effect, we circulated an opinion poll to graduate students in CICS. Our objective was to gauge the degree to which a company's public political stances factors into employment decisions. We focussed on two issues that directly affect students in computer science: President Donald Trump's January 27th travel ban and the administration's proposed Muslim registry. We received 102 responses from a population of approximately 250 students and found that nearly 90% of respondents would prefer to work for a company that has taken a stance against these actions. The full results are summarized in the plots to the right.

The results of this poll suggest that publicly supporting or remaining neutral towards these actions may have a negative effect on a business's ability to recruit talent. We are distributing the results of this poll to companies recruiting on our campus. Further, we are calling on STEM graduate students around the country to exercise their political power and publicly pledge to only work for companies who publicly denounce these orders.


### How can I get involved?

Expanding our sample size by running similar polls at other institutions would help strengthen our message. If you would like to run a similar poll at your institution, please contact us at _cicsresist@gmail.com_ so that we can coordinate and compile results.
