# CICS Opinion Poll

In this day and age, businesses, especially those in the tech industry, can not remain politically or ethically neutral. We believe it is the responsibility of those employed in the tech industry to hold businesses accountable for their political positions. As students, we can exercise this responsibility by taking politics into account when making decisions about where to work. In fact, many students already take the political stances of a company into account. 


To quantify this effect, we circulated an opinion poll to graduate students in CICS. Our objective was to gauge the degree to which the a company's stances on President Donald Trump's January 27th travel ban and the administration's proposed Muslim registry factor into employment decisions. We received 102 responses from a student population of approximately 250 students and the results are summarized below.

The results of this poll suggest that remaining publicly neutral may have a negative effect on a business's ability to recruit talent. We are mobilizing STEM graduate students around the country to publicly pledge to only work for companies who publicly denounce these orders.
